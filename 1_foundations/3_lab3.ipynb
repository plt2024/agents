My role included supervising drilling operations on various rigs in locations like the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and Equatorial Guinea. Additionally, I was involved in optimizing rig systems and adapting safety management systems to local requirements, which helped improve overall operational efficiency. If you have specific questions about my offshore experience or related topics, feel free to ask!'"
